# Releasing to PyPI the Standard Way

This document outlines how to configure, build, and release a Python project to the
test instance of the Python Package Index (PyPI). It uses the official/standard Python
build tools.

To ease releases, and get other benefits like version bumping and changelogs,
additional packages can be used. I've had good luck with Python Semantic Release,
outlined in another document.

## How To Configure

### Create Build Files

Create these files
- `pyproject.toml`: Defines the build system, build dependencies, and other metadata.
- `setup.cfg`: Static metadata. `setup.py` is for dynamic metadata, and should
    be avoided if possible.

Add a block to `setup.cfg` that defines a CLI command, and the corresponding
package function to call. Make sure to use `_` and not `-` in path names.
Below defines the command `hello-pp` to execute the function `main()`,
in the module `hello_pp.cli`.

```
[options.entry_points]
console_scripts =
    hello-pp = hello_pp.cli:main
```

## How To Install and Run Locally

Create a virtualenv (if needed).

```
python3 -m venv ./.venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the build dependencies.

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install setuptools wheel build
```

Install the package locally.

```
pip install .
```

Run the command. It will only be available in the virtualenv (if used).

```
$ hello-pp
Hello Python Project!
```


## How To Release Manually

### Create PyPI Account and Token

Create an account on the test instance of PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/
The production instance of PyPI uses a separate account.

> TestPyPI â€“ a separate instance of the Python Package
> Index that allows you to try distribution tools and processes without affecting
> the real index.

Create a test PyPI API token: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/


### Configure Environment

Set the environment variables with your API token.

```
export TWINE_USERNAME="__token__"
export TWINE_PASSWORD="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Create virtualenv (if needed).

```
python3 -m venv ./.venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


### Install Dependencies

Install build dependencies.

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install setuptools wheel build twine
```

Install package dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Build

Create the distribution

```
python -m build
```

A `./dist` subdirectory will be created, if not present, with the distribution files.
- `package_name-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl`: Built distribution
- `package_name-x.y.z.tar.gz`: Source archive


### Deploy to Test PyPI

Install Twine and use it to upload the package to the test PyPI instance.
This command will read the user and API token from the `TWINE_USERNAME` and
`TWINE_PASSWORD` environment variables.

```
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```


## Install from Test PyPI

Install the test package.

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ js-hello-python-project
```

Run the command. It will only be available in the virtualenv (if used).

```
$ hello-pp
Hello Python Project! (3.0.1)
```
